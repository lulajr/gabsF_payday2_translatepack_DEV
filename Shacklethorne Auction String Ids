Você irá entrar depois do anoitecer, e está nublado e chovendo, então talvez tente fazer tudo silenciosamente se você puder. É uma mansão antiga, mas os sistemas de segurança são bem sólidos, com bastante atualizações. Nessas circunstâncias, quanto menos atenção você chamar dos policiais, melhor. Mas se você tiver que meter o louco, então meta.</string>

	Line 2469: <string id="rb22_sah_cbf_01">Ok gangue, nós recebemos um comunicado do Elephant. Ele disse que quer nos ajudar. Parece que no começo de 1900, um membro da Kataru roubou o que ele chama de "herança de família". Essa pessoa então comprou uma passagem para a famosa expedição Shacklethorne para a Antártida. A presença dele, segundo o Elephant, fudeu a viagem desde o início. A familiaridade disso não é coincidência, apesar da farsa do Elephant. O navio e a tripulação sumiram, até que um tempo atrás, acharam os destroços esmagados no gelo, longe da rota planejada da viagem. Há alguns milhas dos destroços também foram achados um trenó com alguns artefatos e um corpo mumificado que parece ter morrido horrivelmente. Os itens recuperados serão leiloados secretamente para um grupo de pessoas decadentes, e o Elephant disse que uns desses itens nos ajudará com o dispositivo na cozinha. Eu tenho uma sensação bem estranha sobre isso. Isso tem tudo a ver.</s...
